# Contributing to Repo
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer
We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

We Use Github Flow, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:
- Fork the repo.
- If you've added code that should be working and legit code.
- Update the corresponding readme files, like including question/solution/articles,etc links
- Make sure your code lints.
- Issue that pull request!
- Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same MIT License that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

### Report bugs using Github's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!
Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

### Great Bug Reports tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Conditions on which the given code will fail
- Be specific!
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
People love thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

### Use a Consistent Coding Style
- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- Include problem statements from codes using comment
- File should be of proper extension
