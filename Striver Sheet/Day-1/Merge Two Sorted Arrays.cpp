/*
Merge Two Sorted Arrays
=======================

Given two sorted arrays, we need to merge them in O((n+m)*log(n+m)) time with O(1) extra space into a sorted array, when n is the size of the first array, and m is the size of the second array.

Example:  
Input: ar1[] = {10};
       ar2[] = {2, 3};
Output: ar1[] = {2}
        ar2[] = {3, 10}  

Input: ar1[] = {1, 5, 9, 10, 15, 20};
       ar2[] = {2, 3, 8, 13};
Output: ar1[] = {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
        ar2[] = {10, 13, 15, 20}
